## 📖 Scenario  
You'll be working with a provided **[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/5Bw2nC4RgTSSDBxDgW5GiA/FE-Test?node-id=0-1&p=f)** to complete this challenge. The focus is **data integration**, **design fidelity** and **component creation**, we want to see how closely you can translate design intent into front-end code, while building in a way that anticipates future changes.  

Within the Figma file, you'll find a section titled **“Components”**, which includes:  
- **Card**  
- **Instrument**  
- **Type**  

You'll also see **one animation sequence** in the section titled *“Order form protoype”*. Frame steps are visible there, and you can view the prototype by pressing **Shift + Spacebar** or via this link:  
👉 [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/STwysTPYIZfV3pzNm1TvMq/FE-Test-%7C-2?node-id=1-15642&m=dev&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=1%3A3&starting-point-node-id=1%3A15642)

## 📝 Tasks  

1. **Implement the Invest and Discover page** as shown in the Figma mockup.  
2. **Implement the BUY animation sequence** based on the frame steps provided.  
3. **Design an ideal API / data source for your equity positions**:  
   - Define the structure of the data you would expect from one or more APIs.  
   - Be realistic: don't assume all necessary data will come from a single endpoint.  
   - Show how this data structure would power your components effectively.  

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas  

- **Design Precision**  
  Your implementation should match the provided Figma designs as closely as possible (spacing, typography, component behavior and animation accuracy etc.).  

- **Component Thinking**  
  Build components in a way that allows them to be reused and updated. Future design changes should be easy to accommodate.

- **UX / UI Assumptions**  
  Where the design doesn't explicitly define behavior (e.g. hover states, edge cases, other), make thoughtful assumptions and clearly document them.  

- **API / Data Modeling**  
  Propose a realistic and well-structured holdings data source that reflects how a front-end developer would typically consume APIs. Other data sets required have been provided.

- **Data Integration & Composition**  
  Combine multiple data outputs into a single, UI-ready view model.

---

## 📦 Deliverables  

- A working Angular (optional + Ionic) project.  
- A **README** describing:  
  - Any design assumptions you made.  
  - How your components were structured to handle future design updates.  
  - The data source/API design you created and how it connects to your implementation.  
- The implemented **Invest and Discover** pages and **order purchase animation sequence**.  

---

## 🕑 Time Expectation  

This task is designed to take around **4 hours (hard cap 4)**, but we understand everyone works differently. Please don't over-engineer; focus on **quality and detail**, not quantity.  

Please stop at the cap and note trade-offs or unfinished items in the README. Focus on design fidelity, clean componentisation, the alert animation, and a realistic API/data model. Extras are optional.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Access to the Figma file is password-protected. The password will be provided by a member of the Stake team along with when this task is handed over.
- Please ensure you can log in to a free Figma account to use the Inspect tools effectively to complete the challenge.

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- Do not include references to Stake developers or real company code
- Focus on your best practices, clean code, and component architecture
